# Personal Kanban tool

This is a tool for personal kanban organization workflow. You'd
think that there would be a SAAS solution that worked great, but
none of them are quite flexible enough to adapt.

This is the format that I've found most useful, basically a Kanban
flow for work, a kanban flow for home, and person-based context for
tracking items related to specific people.
